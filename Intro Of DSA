What is DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)? 
-> Data structures are specialized formats for organizing and storing the data in a computer. 
-> And essential for managing the large datasets and in various applications. 
   Examples: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables. 
-> Algorithm: A step-by-step procedure or set of rules to solve a particular problem. 
   Examples: Searching, Sorting, Traversing, Insertion, Deletion.

Data structures and algorithms (DSA) are important for many reasons, including:

• Efficient coding
• Problem solving
• Data organization
• Job prospects
• Data engineering

Main point: In structure ,that is capable of holding the data and existing certain behavior.

                    |                                                      |                                                                
         Primitive Data Structures                             Non-Primitive Data Structures
Primitive Data Structures: These are basic building blocks for data manipulation, including:

Integers : Whole numbers.
Float : Decimal numbers.
Characters : Single letters or symbols.
Boolean : Holds true or false values.

Non-Primitive Data Structures: Complex structures, divided into:

Linear Data Structures: Elements are arranged sequentially.
-Array: A collection of elements identified by index.
  Ex: to store the contacts on our phone
-Linked List: A series of nodes, each with data and a reference to the next.
  Ex:  Music Player – Songs in the music player are linked to the previous and next songs.
-Stack: Follows LIFO (Last In First Out) principle.
   Ex: a deck of cards, piles of books, piles of money.
-Queue: Follows FIFO (First In First Out) principle.
   Ex: Cashier line in a store, Tirupathi laddu counter.


Non-Linear Data Structures: Elements are arranged hierarchically.
-Trees: A hierarchical structure with nodes representing data.
   Ex:  Facbook and Instagram comments
-Graphs: Nodes connected by edges representing relationships.
   Ex: Google Maps to find the shortest route between two locations
